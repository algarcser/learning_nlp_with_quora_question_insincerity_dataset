According to the research the following code artifact is an adaptation of Peter Norvig’s spell checker. It uses word2vec ordering of words to approximate word probabilities. Word2vec, a model created from google, it orders the words in terms of frequency, we can then suppose that the misspelled words will have really low frequence since they are involuntary mistakes, that is why they will be few. If that is the case, then we can set up a cut of frequency, and stablish whish ones are misspelled. "
